# Little Lemon webstie
It's a single page application built using React-Js for The Little Lemon restaurant where customers can learn more about the restaurant, see the menu and make a reservation throught a multistep form.
This project is a developed version capstone project of Meta Frontend Certificate where I added more pages like the menu and the multistep form.
